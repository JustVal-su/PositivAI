# PositivAI
![Banner for the readme](https://github.com/JustVal-su/PositivAI/blob/main/Banni%C3%A8re.png?raw=true)  
What if ai was created in... before?
A fake AI chatbot in a retro style.

## Context (fictional)
A startup, named EyeI, created somethin fictional called artificial intelligence : you say something and the AI answer. That look like magic! But AI doesn't work as much EyeI said that would... 
The enterprise had no luck : other companies take legal action and EyeI was forced to close.

## Too bad but... is PositivAI worth it?
Yes... No, absolutely no. But you can take a look ;) or not if you don't now, you'r right!

## I made this "chatbot" in about, uh, one month I think (the date of the first commit)
But I'm lazy and the major part of the project was made in one week.

# So, why are you still reading? Test the "AI", no?
Project made with ❤️ by Just_Val - "su" in JustVal-su mean SuperUser even if you don't demand it - thank you for testing (or just reading, that's cool too) - sorry for my bad english!
